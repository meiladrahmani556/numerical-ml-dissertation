# Project Setup and Scope

## Aim
The aim of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to numerical data in order to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Motivation
Numerical data is widely used in real-world engineering, financial, and industrial applications. This project focuses on extracting insights and building reliable predictive models using such data.

## Planned Workflow
1. Dataset selection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data preprocessing
4. Baseline model development
5. Model improvement and optimisation
6. Evaluation and comparison
