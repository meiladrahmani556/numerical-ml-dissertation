Machine learning project using numerical data for predictive analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on analysing numerical datasets to solve a predictive problem. The project follows a standard data science workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, optimisation, and evaluation.

This work is part of an academic dissertation and is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Objectives
- Select and justify a suitable numerical dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Develop baseline and improved machine learning models
- Evaluate and compare model performance using appropriate metrics

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
